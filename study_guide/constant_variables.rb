=begin
When creating classes there may be values that shouldn't be changed. To prevent
a value from changing a variable called a "constant" can be used. A constant is
defined using the all uppercase letters for its name, like this:
`NAME = 'Sheila'`. Constants can be defined with just the first letter
uppercase but convention  dictates all uppercase is used. Technically a
constant's value can be changed but Ruby will throw a warning.
